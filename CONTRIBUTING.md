# Contributing

This project is open to contributions from anyone and is a participant in Hacktoberfest.

Please pick from the issues something you would like to contribute.
If you think this project needs something that isn't addressed in the list of issues, please add it as an issue.

Please read the README and review the license before contributing to this project.
Contributions that are considered out-of-scope may not be merged into the project. Make sure you are addressing an
existing issue, bug, or feature. If your work does not have an issue, bug, or feature, please create one with a well
defined scope.

## Tests

If you are contributing code, you should also contribute the unit tests you are using to test the performance of your code.

If you are contributing code that is used in GUI, you do not need to submit tests. But if you feel inspired, any unit tests or GUI based testing framework will be accepted if it is well implemented.

## Commits

Please sign your commits. Establishing a git signature and using it for each commit will improve tracibility in the code you create.

GitHub has excellent documentation to help you learn how to sign your commits.

There is a way to sign your commits without having to retype a password each time.
Visit <https://gist.github.com/BoGnY/f9b1be6393234537c3e247f33e74094a> for more about that.

Pull requests that contain unsigned commits CANNOT be merged into development.

## Pull Requests

Leave a comment describing the changes in your pull request. Include the issue or bug this pull request is related to.

Your pull request may not be immediately approved. During the month of October, this repo will be closely monitored,
but at other times, responses may be slow.

Your pull request approval may also be pending response comments from the maintainer's review. Please be patient and
understand that the maintainer is probably very confused and would mostly just like to learn from your contributed
skills. =D

As part of your pull request, please add your name to the list of contributors below.
